      <p id="normal">Hi, my name is <b>Marc Adrian Jimenez</b>, 17 years old, taking up <u>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science specializing in Computer Networks.</u> My nickname is <b>Marc </b><del>,but my father calls me <i>balong</i></del> and currently, I'm a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student, and so far, I'm enjoying and crying about my current stay in APC. I enjoy what I do at school because the interest I have for my chosen course grows and grows everyday. Crying because everything that we do gets harder and harder every term, but I know that I can motivate myself to finish this course and continue living my life and trying again when I drastically failed in this path.</p>

                <p> My name is Marc Adrian P. Jimenez, a 2nd year student taking up BSCS-CN (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
                Specializing in Computer Networks)</p>

                <h2>Why do this Exercise?</h2>

                <p>I dont know. I think that in the future, I will mainly focus on hardwares and the physical connections of devices,
                but learning a little about making websites will be a great perk for me in the future. Why? Because I can make those
                verification websites when you connect to a network.</p>

                <h2>Am I enjoying doing this?</h2>

                <p>Just like any coding subject, it is fun and ejoyable when it works, but when you already made a ton of changes
                 but it still wont work, it starts to become boring.</p>
