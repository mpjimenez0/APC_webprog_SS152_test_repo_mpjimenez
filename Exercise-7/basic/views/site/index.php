                <p> My name is Marc Adrian P. Jimenez, a 2nd year student taking up BSCS-CN (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
                Specializing in Computer Networks)</p>

                <h2>Why do this Exercise?</h2>

                <p>I dont know. I think that in the future, I will mainly focus on hardwares and the physical connections of devices,
                but learning a little about making websites will be a great perk for me in the future. Why? Because I can make those
                verification websites when you connect to a network.</p>

                <h2>Am I enjoying doing this?</h2>

                <p>Just like any coding subject, it is fun and ejoyable when it works, but when you already made a ton of changes
                 but it still wont work, it starts to become boring.</p>
