		<h1> METANOIA </h1>
		
		<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p> 
			Hi, my name is <strong>Marc Adrian Pabale Jimenez</strong>, 17 years old, taking up <u>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science specializing in Computer Networks</u>. My nickname is <em>Marc</em> ,<del>but my father calls me balong and currently,</del> I'm a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student, and so far, I'm enjoying and crying about my current stay in APC. I enjoy what I do at school because the interest I have for my chosen course grows and grows everyday. Crying because everything that we do gets harder and harder every term, but I know that I can motivate myself to finish this course and continue living my life and trying again when I drastically failed in this path.
